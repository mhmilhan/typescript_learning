## TYPESCRIPT LEARNING BY DOING PROJECT

#### DESCRIPTION:
I have worked on several projects to learn TypeScript, as I believe in learning by doing.
I would also like to credit freeCodeCamp for their generous initiative.
Most of these projects involve converting vanilla JavaScript code to TypeScript to better understand its concepts.

#### RESOURCES:
While learning TypeScript, I explored numerous websites, including the official TypeScript documentation.
For future reference, I have compiled all key details into a .docx file.
